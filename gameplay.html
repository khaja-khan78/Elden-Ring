        <h2>The Chapel of Anticipation</h2>

                <p>
                    Before exploring the Lands Between, you start by creating your character—choosing a class and keepsake item that shape your early game. After customizing, a cutscene introduces you inside the Chapel of Anticipation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Loot the glowing body to get the Tarnished’s Wizened Finger. Cross the bridge and a boss, the Grafted Scion, will ambush you. Defeating it gives rare loot, but losing still progresses the story as you awaken elsewhere.
                </p>

        <h2>Stranded Graveyard & Tutorial</h2>
        <div class="content-row">

                <p>
                    After awakening, you’ll get healing flasks and meet a ghost near a pit. Jump in to access the tutorial area. It teaches basic combat like dodging, blocking, and using magic or melee attacks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You’ll face the Soldier of Godrick at the end—a simple boss meant to help you practice. Beating him gives Runes and the “Strength!” gesture.
                </p>

        <h2>Moving Forward</h2>

                    After the tutorial, collect multiplayer items and activate a nearby Site of Grace. You'll see an Imp Statue, which needs two Stonesword Keys to open a hidden dungeon. It's tough, so consider returning later.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ride the lift, climb the stairs, and open the door to reach Limgrave—the start of your true journey in Elden Ring.
