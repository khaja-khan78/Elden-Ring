He secretly defends the Erdtree from all who seek to claim its power, including the Tarnished. When confronted in the Capital, he reveals his identity and fights with great ferocity, wielding cursed blood and spectral weapons.

Despite this, he is defeated and his Great Rune claimed.Later, Nepheli Loux is named ruler of Limgrave, restoring dignity to the region.</p>
