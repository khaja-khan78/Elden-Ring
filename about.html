        <h2>Welcome To The World Of Elden Ring</h2>
        <p>The world of <strong>Elden Ring</strong> is a vast, dark, and deeply immersive fantasy realm known as The Lands Between. Created by FromSoftware and directed by Hidetaka Miyazaki, with worldbuilding by George R.R. Martin, it expands on the studio’s signature cryptic storytelling and challenging gameplay. The Lands Between is both beautiful and brutal—a place where grandeur and decay coexist in haunting harmony.</p>

        <h3>Shattered World</h3>
        <p>At the heart of the world stands the Erdtree, a massive, luminous tree that dominates the skyline and symbolizes divine power. Once unified under the Elden Ring, the realm fell into ruin after the Ring was shattered. This cataclysm, known as the Shattering, triggered a brutal war among demigods—each claiming fragments of the Ring and vying for dominance. From the storm-lashed cliffs of Stormveil Castle to the scarlet rot-plagued wastelands of Caelid, every region reflects the corruption and madness left in the wake of divine collapse.</p>

        <h4>The Tarnished</h4>
        <p>You play as a Tarnished, an exile summoned back to the Lands Between to restore the Elden Ring and become the Elden Lord. Once stripped of the Erdtree's grace, the Tarnished return empowered by a mysterious calling. With no set path or guidance, players must uncover secrets, face nightmarish foes, and piece together the hidden lore scattered across a broken world.</p>

        <h5>Mythology and Lore</h5>
        <p>The game’s mythology is rich and interpretive. George R.R. Martin crafted the backstory, while Miyazaki and his team integrated it into environmental storytelling, cryptic item descriptions, and fragmented dialogue. Themes of ambition, decay, divine will, and cyclical power dominate the narrative. Characters like Queen Marika the Eternal, Radagon, and their demigod children form a divine dynasty torn by ambition and tragedy.</p>

        <h6>Exploration and Beauty</h6>
        <p><strong>Elden Ring</strong> sets itself apart with its open-world design. Unlike previous Souls games, players can roam freely on foot or horseback—uncovering hidden dungeons, underground cities, and forgotten ruins. Its art direction fuses ancient grandeur with gothic horror, making each location feel like a chapter from a lost legend.</p>
